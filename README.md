## Portfolio Website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a software developer.

### Features:
- Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and SEO benefits.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsive design.
- Includes sections for project highlights, skills, and contact information.

### About the Scraping Website:
I also developed a scraping website as part of my portfolio, demonstrating web scraping techniques and data visualization.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own portfolio website!
